# Code
Note: You will be working with .h files instead of .c to save time on my end. All functions have the required return type, name, and parameters. If you change any of these, the program is unlikely to compile. Only modify the function body. There is no need to create extra methods (unless specified). Should you need to make a new function, be sure to use the inline keyword.
